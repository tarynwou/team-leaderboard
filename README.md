# Team Leaderboard

## Gamified Teamwork & Productivity


***What Does This Program Do?***

The application will be a **internal ranking system** where users can add the names of their team members and their 
corresponding tasks and acts of service they've completed for the team. When the user (a manager) records a task that
was completed by one of their teammates, that teammate will gain a certain amount of points. The number of points 
each member has will be reflected through the leadership board. The intention is to *create an incentive for teams 
to be more productive and engage in organizational citizenship behaviour* through gamification.

> Users will consist of managers who want to track progress and determine how much each of their team members have 
contributed to the team or organization.

***Why I Want to Pursue This Project:***
- I've had an idea for this in mind for a while with no way of implementing this, so I think this would be a good 
opportunity to try it out!
- I manage a team myself, and I personally think this would be very useful to track and reward engaged teammates.
- I've always enjoyed video games and find gamification of anything to be a good incentive.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add and remove teammate profiles to and from the system
- As a user, I want to be able to log an entry with a task type, comment, and the respective team member who completed it
- As a user, I want to be able to deduct points from a teammate
- As a user, I want to be able to reset the point system
- As a user, I want to be able to save my leaderboard to file
- As a user, I want to be able to reload my last leaderboard from file

## Phase 4: Task 2
I have chosen to test and design my Leaderboard class to be robust.
