## Gamified Education


***What Does This Program Do?***

The application will be a **simple rpg-like learning platform** where users can move a character around the interface 
to take and navigate through different life courses. The intention is to create an engaging learning environment that
*gamifies the learning experience* for users with points.

> Users will consist of high school or university students who would like to prepare themselves for the real world 
with practical lessons about life. 

***Why I Want to Pursue This Project:***
- I've had this idea in my mind for a couple months with no way of executing it, so this is the perfect 
opportunity for me to start!
- One day, I'd like to found an ed-tech social enterprise, and I think this project aligns with that goal.
- Personally, I have a huge passion for learning (personal development), and video games have been a big part of my 
childhood, so I wanted to combine these two interests.
- I would also like to learn life skills or how to be an adult, ideally sometime in university.
